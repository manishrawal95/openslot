## What It Does

You share a link. Someone picks a time. You both get a calendar invite with a Google Meet link, a confirmation email, and automatic reminders before the meeting.

If they need to reschedule or cancel, they can do that too -- no account required, no back-and-forth emails.

That's it.

## Why Not Just Use Calendly?

Calendly's free tier locks the features people actually use behind a $20/month paywall.

## How It Works

```
Guest picks a time → Booking confirmed
                          ├→ Google Calendar event created (+ Meet link)
                          ├→ Confirmation email sent (with ICS attachment)
                          └→ Reminders scheduled (24h + 1h before)

Guest clicks manage link → Verified via HMAC token
                          ├→ Reschedule → new time, updated calendar event, new emails
                          └→ Cancel → event deleted, cancellation email, reminders cancelled
```
